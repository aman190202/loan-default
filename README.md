Creating a robust model that can help lenders and financial institutions make informed decisions on extending or denying credit


## How is credit scored?

Credit scoring is the process used by lenders and credit agencies to evaluate the creditworthiness of a borrower. The score is based on various factors that can include payment history, outstanding debts, length of credit history, new credit applications, and types of credit used. Here are some of the key factors that are typically considered in credit scoring:

1. Payment history: This is the most important factor in determining your credit score. Lenders want to see that you make your payments on time and in full. Late payments, missed payments, and defaulting on loans can significantly lower your credit score.
Credit utilization: This refers to the amount of credit you are currently using compared to your credit limit. A high credit utilization ratio can indicate that you are overextended and may have trouble paying back your debts.
2. Length of credit history: Lenders prefer borrowers who have a long credit history with a track record of responsible credit use. This factor is based on how long you have had credit accounts open and how often you use them.
3. New credit applications: Every time you apply for credit, it generates an inquiry on your credit report. Too many inquiries can suggest that you are desperate for credit or may be taking on too much debt at once.
4. Types of credit used: Lenders like to see a mix of credit types, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages, rather than relying solely on one type of credit.

These factors are used to calculate your credit score, which can range from 300 to 850. The higher your score, the better your creditworthiness and the more likely you are to be approved for loans and credit cards with favorable terms and rates.

## FICO Score

One of the most commonly used credit scoring models is the FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850. The formula used to calculate the FICO score is not publicly disclosed, but it is based on the following factors and their approximate weightings:

1. Payment history (35%): This factor looks at whether you have made payments on time, the number of late payments, and the severity of any missed payments or defaults.
2. Amounts owed (30%): This factor takes into account the total amount of debt you have and your credit utilization ratio, or the percentage of your available credit that you are using.
3. Length of credit history (15%): This factor considers how long you have had credit accounts open and how often you use them.
4. New credit (10%): This factor looks at how often you apply for new credit and how many new accounts you have opened recently.
5. Types of credit used (10%): This factor considers the mix of credit types you have, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages.

## FICO Score's effect on my credit?

Your FICO score can have a significant impact on your ability to obtain credit and the terms and interest rates that you may qualify for. A higher FICO score generally indicates that you are a lower risk borrower, and lenders may be more willing to extend credit to you with more favorable terms and interest rates. Here is an example of how a FICO score can impact your credit:

Let's say you are applying for a $20,000 auto loan with a repayment period of five years. If you have a FICO score of 750, you may qualify for an interest rate of around 3.5%. This would result in monthly payments of $364 and a total repayment amount of $21,847.

However, if you have a lower FICO score, say 650, you may only qualify for an interest rate of around 7.5%. This would result in monthly payments of $399 and a total repayment amount of $23,935. Over the course of the loan, you would end up paying almost $2,100 more in interest due to your lower credit score.
